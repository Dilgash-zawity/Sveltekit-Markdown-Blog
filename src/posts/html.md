# Introduction to HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages.

It provides the basic structure for a web page and allows you to embed content such as text, images, links, and more.

## Basic HTML Structure

An HTML document is made up of various elements,

which are defined using tags. Here's a basic structure of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <section id="home">
            <h2>Home</h2>
            <p>This is the home section of the page.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This section contains information about me.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="contact">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>Feel free to reach out to me!</p>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

```
